I have had numerous problems since the transmission fix but XXXX claims that the car is fine. I have not been late on a payment in the entire two-year process, I have paid XXXX on the car and still owe another XXXX. I was a fresh XXXX years of age when I purchased the car so i feel like XXXX XXXX really took advantage of my ignorance and I feel that this is way unfair.
